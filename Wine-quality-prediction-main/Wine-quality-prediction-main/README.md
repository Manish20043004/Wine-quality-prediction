# Wine-quality-prediction
In the wine industry, accurately identifying the type of wine is essential for quality control, labeling, and customer satisfaction. Traditional classification methods, such as expert tasting or manual chemical testing, are often time-consuming, expensive, and prone to human error. With the availability of large datasets containing physicochemical properties of wines, there is a growing need for automated, reliable, and scalable solutions for wine type prediction. However, traditional machine learning models may struggle to capture the complex, nonlinear relationships between features. This project addresses the challenge by applying machine learning techniques like random forest algorithm to classify wine types based on their chemical attributes. The goal is to build a model that not only improves accuracy but also adapts well to real-world wine classification tasks.
